This are the main scripot files.
The primary file is the function2.py, this file contais all the functions used in the simulation and analysis scripts 
An explanation of each function and their inputs are given in the functions2 file.
Each analysis file has a shortt desciption of what the file is meant to do, however not a step by step guide.
All these functions assume a contellation of three elements though it easily be modified to expand to a any number.
Most functions use the shape the shape of the arrays as the determining factor for number of elements and number of measurements (though some do explicitely expect three inputs)
