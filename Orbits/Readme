This are the scripts used for the orbit simulations. To be used with TUdat (Tu Delft astrodynamic toolbox)
the perturbed_lunar_sat.cpp file contains the eventually used C++ script used to simulate the frozen orbit at a 2338km. 
The map of moontests contains the full working directory that can be used in a Tudat install including the executables to run the simulations (names might be different)
The name within the exetutables for the frozen orbit simulation is moon_perturbed_test2
