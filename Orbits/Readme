This are the scripts used for the orbit simulations. To be used with TUdat (Tu Delft astrodynamic toolbox)
the perturbed_lunar_sat.cpp file contains the eventually used C++ script used to simulate the frozen orbit at a 2338km. 
The map of moontests contains the full working directory (including cmake and stuff) that can be used in a Tudat install (Just plug into your tudat applications folder)

includes the executables to run the simulations (names might be different)The name within the exetutables for the frozen orbit simulation is moon_perturbed_test2
as well as folders to store the output .dat files

The orbitplot is a small python script to visualize the output .dat files
